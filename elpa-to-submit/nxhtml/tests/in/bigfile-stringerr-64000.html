          <dd>
            <p>
              I want to thanks the testers (who have been many now),
              especially to my first testers Hadron Quark and Eric
              Lilja, for helping me by testing and pointing out bugs
              and weaknesses, most of them related to editing of PHP.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without testers all kind of problems I just can't
              imagine myself would still be there in nXhtml.  For
              example Hadron told me once that he got the error
              <i>(wrong-type-argument stringp nil)</i>. Eh, I replied, are
              you sure. Yes he was. I tried the same file as him. No
              error.
            </p>
            <p>
              The error happened during fontification so the error
              message above was all we had.  A real black box for
              me. Or perhaps black magic?  After much confusion and
              some hard work we finally found out what it was and I
              implemented a better way to catch such errors. If Hadron
              would have given up the problem would still have been
              there. Some problems are just impossible to solve
              without good cooperation. So, again, thanks Hadron.
            </p>
            <p>
              BTW, I will perhaps add some even better way to Emacs to
              catch these errors so other can benefit from our
              insights too, but that requires some time and effort
              which I can't afford right now.

              I wrote earlier that I thought that there were two parts
              in nXhtml, nxhtml-mode and mumamo with a bit different
              degree of maturity.  I believe that is not that valid
              any more. To my delight the second part, mumamo is now
              also quite stable (from version 1.27).

            <p>
              Sometimes the major mode that Emacs opens a file in is
              not what you expect. This can happen with files like PHP
              files.  The reason might be that magic-mode-alist have
              choosen a mode based on the content of the file. The way
              this is done does not take files with mixes a mix of for
              example XHTML and PHP into account.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may try setting magic-mode-alist to nil if this is a
              problem for you.

            <p>
              <em>
                This is now no longer necessary since the introduction
                of magic-fallback-mode-alist in CVS Emacs on 2007-05-16.
                (If you have an Emacs newer than that, of course.)

          <dt id="underline-bug" style="margin-top:1em;">Long Red Underlines</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Because of a bug in Emacs 22.1 you can sometimes (at the
              end of a line) get long red lines instead of just a
              single underlined character.  Many users (me included)
              find this quite a bit disturbing. I have therefore added
              a command to quickly hide/show the underlines. This is
              on <em>C-c C-w</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is particular useful for example in the case where
              you edit a PHP file and are bound to get a lot of XHTML
              validation errors.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt id="php-attribute-values" style="margin-top:1em;">Attribute values computed by PHP</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              If you want to have attribute values computed by PHP
              here is a way how to structure that to avoid breaking
              completion and validation in the XHTML part unnessecary:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:2em">
              &lt;img src=&quot;images/linux.png&quot; title=&quot;&lt;?php foo(&quot;bar&quot;);?&gt;&quot;/&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately that still breaks XHTML validation since
              &lt; is not allowed in strings.  In the long run I
              believe the XML validator has to be broken up so that it
              avoids parsing the string here (in PHP files).
            </p>
            <p>
              For now I have implemented a workaround.
              If you are using constructs like those above then turn on <em>nxhtml-strval-mode</em>.
              This will temporarily replace the above with
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:2em">
              &lt;img src=&quot;images/linux.png&quot; title=&quot;&#171;?php foo(&quot;bar&quot;);?&#187;&quot;/&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
              However on the screen you will still see the original
              string and when writing to file the correct characters
              will be used.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt id="pi-note" style="margin-top:1em;">A note for PHP and its cousins</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              The rules for a process instruction in XML, like &lt;?php
              ... ?&gt; says that the text can contain any text except
              <em>?&gt;</em>. So if you want to output that string
              from PHP then break it up so it does not look as ?&gt; in
              the source file.
            </p>
            <p>
              It might be good to break up the beginning part of the
              process instructions too.  And please note that to use
              XHTML validation or completion you should avoid using
              &lt; in strings, since it is not allowed there.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some people have asked why the way to specify chunks in
              mumamo-mode is not compatible with the old mmm-mode. The
              answer is that I was not sure that the way used in
              mmm-mode for specifying the chunks was flexible enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              And I am sure that even the way used in mumamo-mode is
              not good enough for all cases, but I let it be the way
              it is until I have a better understanding of the
              problem. Suggestions and comments are welcome!

              <li>
                More conventient handling of links. They can now be
                opened in the same window, 'other window' or in a new

                Schema was not setup after starting new page so
                completion did not work. Fixed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added http://xhtml.com/ to help sites for XHTML.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added the concept of <em>fictive XML validation
                headers</em>.  These are just text parsed by the nXml
                validation parser to get a start state before starting
                parsing a buffer.  This allows the use of the nXml
                completion in buffers where there are no XML header.
                Such a header is often lacking for example in PHP code
                since the XHTML header is often generated dynamically.
              </li>
              <li>
                Because of the change above <em>nxhtml-part-mode</em>
                is no longer needed and is therefore declared
                obsolete.
              </li>
              <li>
                Corrected a bug in mlinks.el that prevented opening an

              </li>
              <li>
                Added support for JSP, eRuby and some support for perl

                Mumamo was not found when nXhtml was installed with
                just the zip file. Corrected.  (nXhtml is also

              </li>
              <li>
                Enhancement to mumamo error handling when a bad mode
                specifier for an embedded mode is found.
              </li>
              <li>
                Introduced a bug for empty XHTML documents in

              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                There is what I consider is a bug in Emacs 22.1 in the
                handling of global minor mode that are not distributed
                with Emacs. If they are turned on by customization,
                but loaded after Emacs have loaded the customizations
                (usually in .emacs) then they are not turned on
                correctly. Added work-around for this.

                    Tried to make the concept of <em>Fictive XHTML Validation Header</em>
                    more clear.  Added this visually to the buffer.

                    Added an entry for customization of nXhtml to the menus.

                    The Fictive XHTML Validation Header state were not saved when changing major mode in MuMaMo. Corrected.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added more alternatives to the Fictive XHTML Validation Header list.
                    This should make it easier to use completion with for example PHP.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added default value for the Fictive XHTML Validation Header.

                  <li>
                    Tried to make the use of Fictive XHTML Validation Header more automatic and therefore useful.
                    Also tried to make it play better with setting schema file.
                    (There is no need normally to set schema file by hand.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To turn this on by default customize nxhtml-global-validation-header-mode.

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Possible to hide validation warnings without turning
                on validation (which would make completion in the

              </li>
              <li>
                Some fixes to php-mode:
                <ul>
                  <li>Using the character # for comments now works for most cases.</li>
                  <li>Now uses the fontification faces in a more standard way which calms down the look.</li>
                  <li>Initialization bug fixes.</li>
                  <li>Renamed php-mode-user-hook to php-mode-hook to follow standard.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Indentation fixes:

                  <li>
                    Various corrections to indentation in mumamo.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added the possibility to use TAB to indent regions
                    (indent-region-mode).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Warn about bad indentation in mixed PHP/HTML code
                    when using php-mode only.

              </li>
              <li>
                Fontification now fontifies all text first in main
                major mode and thereafter applies submodes. (This
                avoids some problems with around a submode chunk.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Reorganized the nXhtml menu:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    There is now a minor mode for the nXhtml
                    menu. This makes it possible to easier use common
                    features when in buffers not in nxhtml-mode.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The nXhtml menu does not disappear when moving
                    into a chunk where the major mode is not
                    nxhtml-mode.  The changes also makes it easy to
                    access uploading functions functions etc from
                    other modes than nxhtml-mode since the
                    <em>nXhtml</em> may also be shown in them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The nXhtml menu can be turned on globally by default.
                    Customize nxhtml-menu-mode for that.

                Reached version number 1.00 - which you maybe believe
                means the bugs should be gone? Sorry, it is just that
                I ran out of version numbers. However it looks like
                much fewer bugs at least.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fixed problems mostly related to global turn on of different features in nXhtml.

                    Made the support for perl here documents a bit better.
                    Large perl documents are however still quite slow when

                    Refontification could miss some parts when buffer

                    useful. Changed keybindings in mumamo-test.el from

                    Renamed mumamo-notest.el to mumamo-test.el.  Added it

                    Completion menu: Renamed to <i>Completion and

                  <li>
                    Renamed <i>view</i> to <i>browse</i> since this is
                    the normal emacs name for showing files in a web

                    Multiple major mode turned on by default for .rhtml files when this mode is global.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Multiple major mode is no longer turned on when rub-mode is turned on.

              </li>
              <li>
                Added support for switching major mode dependent on if
                Emacs was called as an external editor. This makes it
                possible for example to switch to relevant major and
                minor modes when Firefox add-on It's All Text.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added the possibility to easily view the output of scripts on the server (if they require no parameters).
                You can now do that from the nXhtml menu.
                Previously only html files on the server could be viewed that way.
                Image files can also be viewed this way.

                <ul>

                    Added functions for unfilling.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added keybindings and menu entries for longlines-mode, fill-paragraph and unfill-paragraph.

              </li>
              <li>
                Quoting:
                Added HTML quoting of &amp; and &lt; in text areas. Bound to C-c C-q.
              </li>
              <li>
                Images:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Added image-mode to those that are encompassed by
                    nxhtml-global-minor-mode so that images can be
                    uploaded more easily.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added <em>edit with GIMP</em> and <em>upload</em> to the popup menu for links.
                    This avoids the need to load the linked files in Emacs first.
                  </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Added <em>nxml-untag-element</em>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added a modified version of wikipedia-mode.el. Seems likely to be useful if you are doing web editing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added html-imenu.el

                MuMaMo:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Removed the lighter <i>"MuMaMo"</i> for
                    mumamo-mode. Instead the active major mode now has
                    <b>"/m"</b> appended to mode-name (that is what you see
                    in the mode line).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The normal way to turn on <i>mumamo-mode</i> has
                    changed.  There are now functions that you can use
                    in <i>auto-mode-alist</i> to directly set up the
                    buffer for mumamo-mode.  The available functions
                    are in the
                    variable <i>mumamo-defined-turn-on-functions</i>.
                    <p>
                      You are not supposed to call mumamo-mode
                      yourself any more and mumamo-global-mode is
                      gone. So is also mumamo-chunk-family-by-mode and
                      mumamo-filenames-list.  The functionality those
                      gave are all replaced by the new functions for
                      turning on mumamo mode.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added support for buffer local values in
                    hooks. This is necessary for example to support
                    minor modes that are meant to be buffer local but
                    not major mode specific. Instructions for authors
                    of this kind of minor modes are in the file
                    mumamo.el.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added support for Django.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added support for Embperl.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added support for PHP Smarty. The <i>{literal}
                    ... {/literal}</i> construct is not supported.
                    This mean that you can not use &lt;style ..&gt; or &lt;script ..&gt;.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added support for imenu for the main major mode.
                    Turned on this by default in nxhtml-mode.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Made the temporary replacement of the
                    attr="&lt;?php ... ?&gt;" a bit better.  They are
                    now more visible and also still mumamo chunks
                    during the temporary replacement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added support for <i>flymake-mode</i>.
                    Maybe add support for checking chunks?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Printing: Added htmlfontify.el and
                    hfyview.el. These makes if possible to print a
                    buffer fontified with <i>mumamo-mode</i> on in
                    colors (through your web browser).  There is an
                    example of the capabilities of htmlfontify <a
                    href="htmlfontify-example.html">here</a> (made
                    with a little function in hfyview.el).

                Fictive XHTML Validation Headers: Changed the way they
                are turned on. They may now be turned on when
                mumamo-mode is turned on.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some users want to use their own patched version of
                nXml. Next version of Emacs will come with
                nXml. Therefore, the loading routine for nXhtml now
                checks if nXml is is already loaded. Thanks to Eric
                Lilja for testing this.  Eric also made me aware of
                that if nXhtml was placed in the site-lisp directory
                tree then things did not work as I expected. I think I
                have corrected that by placing a <i>.nosearch</i> file
                at the top of the nxml tree in nXhtml.
              </li>
              <li>
                Restructured the directories. Moved some files out of
                the <i>nxhtml</i> subdir.  Some of them went into the
                <i>util</i> subdir (those are written by me) and some
                to the new subdir <i>related</i> (those that are
                inherited from others, maybe changed by me - most
                often to work with mumamo-mode).
              </li>
              <li>
                Changed all licenses to be GNU GPL.

                Additions to tidy support: It is now possible to use
                the tidy support to tidy the XHTML part of php etc.

              </li>
              <li>
                Added <i>winsize.el</i> which allows interactive resizing of
                windows.  Also added <i>winsav.el</i> which adds the
                capability to rotate window configurations and also to
                save window configuration to file.

                  This will of course case some problems if you do not
                  notice it when you upgrade nXhtml.  If you are using
                  EmacsW32 and upgrade nXhtml you should change the

                <p>
                  The reason for this change is that nXml will soon
                  normally not be part of nXhtml so keeping the old
                  top directory name would be confusing.

                    directly use it from javascript mode without any
                    additional setup.

                    Fixed a bug where I inadvertently
                    added <i>../../lisp</i> to load-path.

                Added the function <i>emacs-Q-nxhtml</i> for easier
                testing. It does the equivalent of <i>emacs -Q --load

                    Forgot to return php-mode in php short tags. Fixed.

                    Borders where not correctly calculated with php short tags. Fixed.

                    Forgot font-lock-syntactic-keywords. This showed up in
                    bad fontification for strings sometimes. Fixed.

                    To fontify keywords font-lock-syntactically-fontified
                    must be set in each chunk. Fixed.

                    Find a way to at least temporarily work around the
                    problem with the last &quote; char in
                    syntax=&quote;...&quote; that could be seen in
                    large XHTML files, for example this file.  The
                    drawback with the work around is that it bypasses
                    the cache for syntax-ppss, but this happens only
                    in multi major mode buffers and I notice no
                    performance problems here.
