;;; init.el --- Where all the magic begins
;;
;; Part of the Emacs Starter Kit
;;
;; This is the first thing to get loaded.
;;
;; "Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the
;; same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger
;; and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish."
;; -Neal Stephenson, "In the Beginning was the Command Line"

;; Load path etc:

(setq dotfiles-dir (file-name-directory
                    (or (buffer-file-name) load-file-name)))
(add-to-list 'load-path dotfiles-dir)
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat dotfiles-dir "/elpa"))
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat dotfiles-dir "/elpa-to-submit"))
(setq autoload-file (concat dotfiles-dir "loaddefs.el"))

;; These should be loaded on startup rather than autoloaded on demand
;; since they are likely to be used in every session:

(require 'cl)
(require 'saveplace)
(require 'ffap)
(require 'uniquify)
(require 'ansi-color)
(require 'recentf)

;; Load up ELPA, the package manager:

(require 'package)
(package-initialize)

;; Load up starter kit customizations:

(require 'starter-kit-lisp)
(require 'starter-kit-defuns)
(require 'starter-kit-bindings)
(require 'starter-kit-misc)
(require 'starter-kit-registers)
(require 'starter-kit-eshell)
(require 'starter-kit-ruby)

(regen-autoloads)

;; You can keep system-specific customizations here:

(setq system-specific-config
      (concat dotfiles-dir system-name ".el"))
(if (file-exists-p system-specific-config)
    (load system-specific-config))

;;; init.el ends here
